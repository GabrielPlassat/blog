**[XPrice](http://www.xprize.org/)** est une fondation qui a pour but de susciter l'innovation dans des secteurs clés, via la compétition. Concernant les transports, le programme Progressive Insurance Automotive X Price existe depuis plusieurs années.

 

The goal of the Progressive Insurance Automotive X PRIZE is to inspire a new generation of super-efficient vehicles that help break our addiction to oil and stem the effects of climate change. Our goal is to inspire a new generation of viable, safe, affordable and super fuel efficient vehicles that people want to buy.

$10 million in prizes will be awarded in September 2010 to the teams that win a rigorous stage competition for clean, production-capable vehicles that exceed 100 MPG energy equivalent (MPGe). Program is described **[here](/assets/images/2010/04/PIAXP_Guidelines_V_1.3.pdf).**

The series of scored performance and evaluation events kicks off April 26, 2010 and continues through the end of August 2010. During this time, the Progressive Insurance Automotive X PRIZE will conduct several competition stages aimed at evaluating the efficiency, safety and performance of each competition vehicle under real world conditions. While in Michigan, the competition will allow the public and the automotive world an opportunity to witness the competition stages as they unfold. Additionally, ongoing and interactive updates will be available online at [www.progressiveautoxprize.org](http://www.progressiveautoxprize.org) throughout the competition stages.

 

The competition stages and public events are as follows. Additional public events may be announced at a later date. 

 

Qualified Teams have passed the second judging stage of the Progressive Insurance Automotive X PRIZE. After acceptance of their Registration Application, these teams have gone on to pass a series of rigorous reviews of their Business Plan and Technical Specifications. They are now working to meet the challenges of the track events, which begin at the end of April 2010.

 

These competitors come from a variety of backgrounds ranging from large auto manufacturers to independent backyard inventors. They heard the call to action and decided that they can make a difference.

 

Each team has a different strategy for winning the Progressive Automotive X PRIZE, and each idea has the potential to revolutionize the world. Their stories are inspiring, and we are pleased to provide you with the opportunity to get to know each of our competitors.
