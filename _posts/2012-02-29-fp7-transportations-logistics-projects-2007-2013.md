Tous les projets en cours dans le domaine des transports de personnes et de marchandises soutenus par la Commission Européenne sont dans le document ci-dessous. En utilisant le module de recherche du document pdf vous pouvez accéder à vos besoins.

 

**Quatre projets par exemple : **

 

[**PICAV **](http://www.dimec.unige.it/PMAR/picav/objectives.shtml): Personnal Intelligent City Accessible Vehicle System.

 
 
- New mobility concept for passengers ensuring accessibility for all in urban pedestrian environments; 
- New transport system that integrates a fleet of PICAV units; 
- Some of its features are specifically designed for people whose mobility is restricted for different reasons the main drivers of PICAV design are: ergonomics, comfort, stability, small size, mobility dexterity on-board intelligence, assisted driving, eco-sustainability, parking, vehicle/infrastructures intelligent networking. 
 

PICAV system usefully integrates the existing public transport system to make it become more accessible for older and disabled people by acting as a smooth link between walking, bicycle and conventional public transport.

 

[**VIAJEO **](http://www.viajeo.eu/): The Viajeo project will design, demonstrate and validate an open platform which will facilitate data sharing and exchange from different sources and provide data processing and management to support a variety of services. The project will integrate the open platform with local components and demonstrate its applications in four cities: Athens, São Paulo, Beijing and Shanghai.

 

The open platform will benefit travellers, transport planners and transport system operators and managers. The open platform will be able to support cross-modal journey planning and seamless traveller information service. Data exchange between operators will lead to a better optimized operation of all systems and individual operation strategies can be harmonized by the data exchanges and information sharing. The platform will enable all data and information used for real-time operation to be used for transport planning. Transport planner will have access to traffic data and information on traffic management strategies. Such information will lead more detailed and comprehensive historical database for transport modelling development and long term policy evaluation.

 

[**TURBLOG_WW :**](http://www.turblog.eu/) The project puts together past urban **logistics **experiences and good practices, analyses them, extracts lessons learned, and disseminates the information at national, European and intercontinental levels, which supports ongoing and future related urban logistics plans. TURBLOG_WW aims at improving awareness, enhance cooperation and exchange of experiences in city logistics best practices between European countries and countries worldwide but with a **focus on the transfer of experiences between the EU, ****Brazil and ****Peru**.

 

[**INTEGRITY **](http://www.integrity-supplychain.eu/): Kernel of the project is the development of the so-called Shared Intermodal Container Information System (SICIS) allowing authorised companies and authorities to access planning and status information of selected transports. Proactive planning following the Supply Chain Event Management (SCEM) approach allows to forecast problems well before they might occur. Matching logistics data with security information, e.g. from electronic seals, container security devices, and scanning equipment together with the integration of the AEO (authorised economic operator) approach allow to satisfy both the logistics industry and Customs Authorities fulfilling their duties thus creating win-win situations.
