L'EPA et le National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) sont en train de revoir l'étiquetage des véhicules neufs aux USA. Ci dessous un exemple d'un véhicule thermique, d'un véhicule électrique  et d'un hybride plug-in où l'on trouve notamment une donnée intéressante l'efficacité énergétique (kWh/km) ... Ceci pourrait donner des idées en Europe ... Noter également l'indication des émissions polluantes en base 10 et un flashcode pour accéder directement à toutes les données et comparer des véhicules entre eux.

**1. **This vehicle is rated a “B” for fuel economy and tailpipe greenhouse gases. The grading system ranges from A+ to D.

 

**2. **A new website that would describe the new labels and include tools to enable consumers to personalize their estimates based on their own driving habits (i.e., annual miles they drive, their fuel cost, etc.)

 

**3. **This vehicle will save $1,900 in fuel expenses over five years compared to the average vehicle. The estimated 5-year fuel cost of this vehicle ($8,100) is $1,900 lower than that of the average gasoline vehicle ($10,000).

 

**4. **This vehicle uses 3.8 gallons of gasoline to travel 100 miles for combined city and highway driving. This is an energy efficiency rate called fuel consumption. Fuel consumption values, unlike MPG, relate directly to the amount of fuel used.

 

**5. **This vehicle can travel about 22 miles on a gallon of gas for city driving.

 

**6.**This bar depicts the range of combined city and highway fuel economy for all labeled vehicles. The pointer shows where this vehicle is within the range.

 

**7.**This text gives the highest and lowest fuel economy of all other vehicles in the same class as the labeled vehicle (e.g. SUVs, minivans, compact cars, etc).

 

**8.** A new website that would describe the new labels and include tools to enable consumers to personalize their estimates based on their own driving habits (i.e., annual miles they drive, their fuel cost, etc.)

 

**9.** A QR CodeTM can be used by many Smartphones to access a web page, allowing consumers at a dealership to compare vehicles and personalize estimates, based on their own driving habits and fuel costs.

 

**10.** This vehicle emits 347 grams of CO2, a greenhouse gas, per mile. This value represents the vehicle’s carbon dioxide (CO2) tailpipe emission rate for combined city and highway driving.

 

**11.** $1,617 is the estimated annual fuel cost based on a given number of miles and fuel price, which are listed lower on the label (15,000 miles per year and $2.80 per gallon for this example).

 

**12.** This vehicle can travel about 32 miles on a gallon of gas for highway driving.

 

**13.** This bar depicts the emission rating for vehicle tailpipe emissions that contribute to local and regional air pollution, creating problems such as haze and smog. The pointer shows where this vehicle is within the range.

 

**14.**This bar depicts the range of the combined city and highway carbon dioxide (CO2) tailpipe emission rate for all labeled vehicles. The pointer shows where this vehicle is within the range.
