State energy and environmental agencies are joining forces with the California Independent System Operator Corporation (California ISO) to expand cooperation for a new era in electricity that keeps California at the forefront of carbon-cutting innovation and green jobs creation. By further coordinating the state's electricity policies, **[California's Clean Energy Future ](http://www.climatechange.ca.gov/energy/index.html)**points the way toward new investments in transmission, energy efficiency, smart grid applications, and increased use of renewable resources.

 

The California Air Resources Board, California Energy Commission, California Environmental Protection Agency, and California Public Utilities Commission are partnering with the California ISO to increase agency coordination and collaboration and ensure California's continued leadership in clean technology and innovation in the coming decade. By increasing transparency and accountability, the Clean Energy Future will bolster accomplishing Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger's 2020 energy policy goals.

 

The document provides the following targets by 2020:

 
 
- Reductions of electricity (13,200 to 18,000 gigawatt-hours) and natural gas use (800 million therms) by 2020. 
- 5,000 megawatts of installed renewable distributed generation statewide at the right locations on the power grid to support reliability and provide economic value. 
- The development of at least one large-scale carbon capture and storage generating facility in California. 
- 1,000 MW of additional storage capacity to be brought onto the system. 
- Developing enough charging stations at home, work, and in public areas to accommodate one million electric and hybrid vehicles.
