 Here’s a great design concept from Chinese designer [Jiang Qian](http://www.coroflot.com/jq/profile), who has a vision to gamify the straps that passengers grip while standing on trains. His idea for a [Game Strap](http://www.coroflot.com/jq/The-joy-of-waiting/) is a pretty creative one, and we hope that one day it becomes a reality. 

The design would include a display is powered by the grip of your hand, and when you let go the game is over. It would also alert you via the display and a vibration when you’re arriving at a station, so that you don’t get carried away and miss your stop.

 

Admittedly, it would be expensive to outfit a train with so many of these Game Straps, although perhaps ad agencies might get in on the action with branded games — because if you’re going to be bombarded with ads on a subway, it would be nice to enjoy them at least.

 

Here in Tokyo, such a device would have to compete with people’s [smartphones](http://www.penn-olson.com/tag/smartphone/), [Nintendo](http://www.penn-olson.com/tag/Nintendo/) DSs, and PSPs for attention. Perhaps a network of Game Straps that creates a social game that everyone on the train could play? It might be fun if such a game was created to connect individuals riding together rather than isolate them.
