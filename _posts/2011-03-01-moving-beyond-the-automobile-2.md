**[Moving Beyond the Automobile](http://www.streetfilms.org/moving-beyond-the-automobile/)** is a ten part video series which explores solutions to the problem of automobile dependency.  It's a visual handbook that will help guide policy makers, advocacy organizations, teachers, students, and others into a world that values pedestrian plazas over parking lots and train tracks over highways.  Cars were then, and this is now.  Welcome to the future.
