Joseph Sussman, MIT professor of Civil & Environmental Engineering discusses the use of congestion pricing as a way to change people’s driving behaviors.  With congestion pricing, certain trips will cost more than other types of trips.  Sussman explains that there will be a lesser need of building more infrastructures that are built for peak hour capacity by enticing people to drive outside the peak hours.  Hear more from Sussman.
