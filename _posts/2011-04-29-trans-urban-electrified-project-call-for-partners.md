The Trans Urban Electrified Project is looking for partners being public or private organisations, setting up a local/regional pilot site.

 

The Trans Urban Electrified Project responds to the 2011 Call For Proposals by the Competitiveness and Innovation Programme (CIP); Information and Communication Technologies Policy Support Programme (ICT PSP); Objective 1.3 - Smart Connected Electro-Mobility; **[Theme Nr. 1: ICT for a low carbon economy and smart mobility](http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/activities/ict_psp/documents/ict_psp_call4_infoday_theme1_obj_13_14.pdf)****.**

 

The Trans Urban Electrified Project aims at following vision statement:

 

**“Use advanced and personalized ICT to uniformly combine and integrate existing electro-mobility solutions and to increase the user’s energy awareness and service experience”**

 

The project is based on three main pillars:

 
 
- use of advanced and personalized ICT 
- combine and integrate existing electro-mobility solutions 
- build user energy awareness & improve user service experience 
 

A number of Pilot applications will carry out the project’s activities. The pilot sites are chosen carefully according to following characteristics:

 
 
- existing electro-mobility related infrastructure 
- electro-mobility projects/efforts/initiatives carried out in the past 
- future potentials for electro-mobility solutions 
- demographics (Urban / Inter-Urban characteristics) 
- power supply infrastructure 
- geographic location 
- economic characteristics of the region
