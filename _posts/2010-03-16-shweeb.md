The idea of riding above the traffic jams on multi-level rails seemed to me the only possible way that Tokyo’s millions of residents could move around the city quickly and safely. It had the added advantages of being environmentally friendly and offering an aerobic workout. To me this was a project that I could, if I put my mind to it, make happen." - Geoff Barnett, **[Shweeb]()** Inventor
