[**Avego**](http://avego.createsend.com/T/ViewEmail/r/A92E48CBBEBA700F/D855A6E4CFCF0F6CF6A1C87C670A6B9F) is pleased to announce that it has partnered with [**VPSI**](http://avego.cmail1.com/t/r/l/ujkriy/cijuixy/p) to develop an integrated technology solution for the company, including providing its groundbreaking [***Shared Transport***](http://avego.cmail1.com/t/r/l/ujkriy/cijuixy/x) technology, all of which will make it easier and more convenient for commuters in the United States to join and use vanpools on their daily commute.

 

 

VPSI is the world’s largest vanpool service provider, with a fleet of more than 5,000 vans accommodating over 25 million passenger trips annually. Avego’s [**end-to-end vanpool management capabilities**](http://avego.cmail1.com/t/r/l/ujkriy/cijuixy/m) are already being enabled in some regions of VPSI’s nationwide transportation network.

 

 

 

 

 *“Due to the ongoing desire of commuters to save money on their daily commutes, as well as an increased awareness of the need for energy independence, reduced carbon emissions, and the sheer convenience of not having to drive to work, VPSI has seen record levels of demand for new vanpools,”* said VPSI President Jeff Henning. *“Our partnership with Avego will give our vanpool customers greater information services, while allowing us to even more rapidly deploy new vanpools.”*

Initially the system is being used to provide automated reporting on passenger miles traveled to government agencies, streamlined vanpool formation and management processes, extensive in-vehicle driver management capabilities, and real-time passenger information. However, the prospect also exists for matching riders with vanpools in real time, if desired by the agency or VPSI’s customers.

Avego’s system includes an in-vehicle touchscreen mobile data terminal (MDT) with GPS and audio announcement capabilities, a web application for commuters to self-organize and grow their vanpools, and extensive reporting capabilities. 

 

Avego’s free [**iPhone app**](http://avego.cmail1.com/t/r/l/ujkriy/cijuixy/g) enables more flexible, convenient and verifiable carpooling by combining GPS-enabled [**real-time ride-matching**](http://avego.cmail1.com/t/r/l/ujkriy/cijuixy/w) with fully automated payment transaction management, real-time passenger information, [**safety features**](http://avego.cmail1.com/t/r/l/ujkriy/cijuixy/yd), and accurate commute reporting. In this way, Avego's technology re-invents carpooling by essentially enabling people to turn their cars into buses.
