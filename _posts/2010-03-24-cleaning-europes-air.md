***A complete, multilingual, one-stop-source of information on Low Emission Zones (LEZs) in ******Europe***

 

 

 

There is now a single website which gives you ***all*** the information you need on Low Emission Zones in one place – and in your language! **www.lowemissionzones.eu** **.**   

 

** **

 

**Why LEZs? **Air pollution kills an estimated 310 000 people a year in Europe. The European Union has set legally defined air quality standards to protect our health. Many cities and towns in most countries in Europe fail to meet these standards. Increasing numbers of cities and towns operate or are preparing “Low Emission Zones”, or “Environment Zones” among other measures, to help meet the standards. There are currently over 160 LEZs in 11 countries in Europe, including cities like Berlin, Amsterdam, London, Milan, but also many smaller towns like Mühlacker (Germany), Como (Italy) or Norwich (UK) - and the A12 motorway in Tirol (Austria).

 

 

 

**LEZs are **areas or roads to which entry is restricted for vehicles with more polluting engines. **Who needs this site? **Anyone who drives around Europe; including hauliers, tourists, lorry and coach operators. It provides all the information needed to navigate around Europe's LEZs – including where to can drive with which vehicles. With one button the website is in your language and the information is in one or two clicks from the homepage.

 

  

 

**Your questions on LEZs are answered** in a regularly updated website, with no adverts or cost to users. Questions like: Where exactly are these zones? Can our vehicles drive into them? What emission standard is my vehicle? Do I have to register before I drive in? How can my vehicle comply with the standards? What air quality impact do LEZs have?

 

 

 

**The EU** is supporting this website with part-funding for 3 years from the 8th December 2009 as part of its implementation of the EU Action Plan on Urban Mobility.

 

 

 

Some complements :

 

 

 

1.		    Air pollution kills more people than road accidents. The human health damage from air pollution is estimated to cost Europe between €427 and €790 billion per year (reference: **[EU Cafe program](http://ec.europa.eu/environment/archives/cafe/general/keydocs.htm)** , also for the air quality deaths). 

 

2.		    More information on the EU air quality limit values can be found **[here ](http://lowemissionzones.eu/what-are-lezs--othermenu-32?start=10)**and also **[here](http://ec.europa.eu/environment/air/legis.htm)**. 

 

3.		    Air quality limit values are not expected to be met by most countries in the EU. Many countries are applying for time extensions for these Limit Values, but not many countries meet the extension requirements (see **[here](http://ec.europa.eu/environment/air/quality/legislation/time_extensions.htm)**). 

 

4.		    LEZs are often one of the most effective local measures to improve air quality to achieve cleaner, and healthier, air. They are implemented as part of a package of measures, tackling different sources. LEZs are one of the measures that must be considered when countries apply for extensions the EU air quality limit values : see **[here](http://eur-%20lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2008:152:0001:0044:EN:PDF)**. 

 

5.		    LEZ are also known as Environment Zones, Green Zones, Umweltzonen, Milieuzones, Lavutslippssone, Miljozone or Miljözon. 

 

6.		    More information on the EU’s Action Plan for Urban Mobility can be found **[here](http://ec.europa.eu/transport/urban/urban_mobility/action_p
lan_en.htm)**.

 

7.		    This project is funded by DG MOVE’s Clean Urban Transport Unit, see **[here](http://ec.europa.eu/transport/urban/index_en.htm)**

 

8.		    More information on the EU Sustainable Energy Week (can be found **[here](http://www.eusew.eu/index.cfm)**)  and DG MOVE’s Conference on Urban Mobility : **[here](http://www.eusew.eu/page.cfm?page=event_content&sby=3&sval=0&sd=40259&id=479)**,

 

9.		    This European LEZ website is run on behalf of the LEEZEN Network of LEZ cities and ministries who want to ensure that drivers can easily find the information they need on LEZs, which now receives EU Commission support with part-funding. LEEZEN (Low Emission and Environment Zone in Europe Network) also supports LEZ authorities with exchanging information and experience between LEZ authorities. The remaining funding for LEEZEN is from Network members and Sadler Consultants Ltd.
