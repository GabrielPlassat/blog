Et oui, en Inde (ou plus exactement à Delhi Gurgaon Noida Faridabad Ghaziabad et Mumbai  Navi Mumbai), Bajaj Ambrish, consultant en énergie renouvelable, lance son site de Covoiturage, [www.esay2commute.com](http://easy2commute.com/index.php). Le site, ciblé sur les déplacements domicile-travail,  propose, entre autre, les voitures disponibles près de chez vous ou de votre bureau.

**[Quelques extraits](http://www.hindustantimes.com/Carpool-for-a-clean-breath/H1-Article1-508167.aspx)** :

 

 It’s a first of its kind NCR-centric website, which has about 3,000 areas/localities in its database to choose from. The website uses a smart technology to suggest available car pools in the vicinity of the user’s office/home. What makes the website unique is the fact that it makes car-pooling user-friendly and secure—you can register on it using only your company e-mail id. Besides, it provides the option of gender (you can opt for an all-female car pool) and ‘secure users’ (whose credential have been confirmed by their employers). Today, about 26 per cent of the total users on the website are verified corporate users and 27 per cent are females.  

 

Today, the website has about 3,500 users and adds 200 more every week. “People are willing to leave their cars at home if they can find a safe and convenient car pool,” says Bajaj. 

 

In fact, easy2commute.com, one of the 52 entries at the Hindustan Times –Brightest  Young Climate Leaders, was also chosen by the Delhi Half-Marathon 2009 to promote carpooling among 30,000 carpool runners. 

 

“On an average, a car releases about 160 grams of emission per km. In a city like Delhi, at least 5 per cent of the total cars can easily be taken off the roads by way of carpooling. Just imagine the difference it would make in reducing carbon emissions,” says Bajaj, who aims to take 5,000 cars off the road in the next one year

 

D’ici à faire du Covoiturage dynamique ou à utiliser des e-nanos en libre-service…
