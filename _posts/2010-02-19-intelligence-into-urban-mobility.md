ERTICO organisait Le 4/02 un workshop sur la **[mobilité urbaine et l'apport des TIC](http://www.ertico.com/en/events/past_events/intelligence_into_urban_mobility_breakfast_workshop.htm)**. 

 

ITS Europe held its second breakfast workshop at the European Parliament on the theme “Intelligence into Urban Mobility”. Co-hosted by Dieter-Lebrecht Koch MEP and Zita Gurmai MEP, the event boasted high level speakers from industry and the European institutions. ERTICO strongly supports its Partners’ and European initiatives in advancing and deploying ITS solutions to make Urban Mobility safer, greener, more economical and more efficient. This needs an approach which involves all stakeholders and activity areas: infrastructure, behaviour and vehicles. A focus on cost-effective and mature solutions and a coordinated implementation is vital.
